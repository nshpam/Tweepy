# 📊 Tweepy – Your Twitterverse ✨📲

In our Software Developer coursework, we utilized the Twitter API to collect tweet data and employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) for in-depth analysis. The program, designed with user-friendly principles, seamlessly integrates Python, Unittest for rigorous testing, and an Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) pipeline for efficient data processing. With a strong emphasis on data visualization techniques, we've created a versatile tool that not only collects Twitter data but also employs NLP for insightful analysis. The program doesn't just gather information; it transforms raw data into meaningful visualizations, showcasing trends and patterns derived from the Twitterverse. This project highlights our collaborative synergy in developing a comprehensive and effective computer program for Twitter data analysis and visualization. We store the data securely in MongoDB.
